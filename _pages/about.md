I received the M.S. degree from Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China, in 2021. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D degree of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China. 
My research interests included Government Bigdata,E-government,Digital Government,Community Service based on Humman Activity Recognition,Machine Learning, Deep Learning,etc. My advisor was A.P [Lei Zhang](http://d.njnu.edu.cn/person/3288.html) during my master's degree, and now my Ph.D supervisor is [Guangwei Hu](https://im.nju.edu.cn/hgw/list.htm). 

By the way, I must express my gratitude to [Stuart Geiger](https://pages.github.com) who supplied the nice academicpages template freely.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
